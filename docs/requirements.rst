Requirements
============

The list that follows below, is a list of physical items needed for your Brewery Pi system. I've also included links for each item that you can buy from Amazon.
These are the items that have been tested by the Brewery Pi Team. You're not required to buy these exact items so feel free to shop around.
However, if you don't want to spend a lot of time researching the different options and vendors, the links below will get you started quickly.
And if you have access to an Amazon Prime account, shipping is free. As of 03/03/2018, the required items totaled $60.61 on Amazon.

Raspberry Pi
------------

This is the computer that Brewery Pi will run on.

`Raspberry Pi on Amazon $35.67. <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CD5VC92/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1>`_

Power Supply
------------

This supplies power, from an outlet, to the Raspberry Pi.

`Power Supply on Amazon $9.99. <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MARDJZ4/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1>`_

Memory Card
-----------

This is the disk for the Raspberry Pi. This will store the Brewery Pi application and your brewing data.

`Memory Card on Amazon $6.99. <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M55C0VU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1>`_

Raspberry Pi Case
-----------------

We all know that a brewery can be a wet and dusty environment. While a case is not necessarily required, I'd recommend one to protect your Raspberry Pi.

`Raspberry Pi Case on Amazon $7.96 <https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Case-Black-fits/dp/B00UW2G1BS/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1520122343&sr=1-3&keywords=raspberry+pi+case&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011>`_

Micro SD Card Reader *(Optional)*
---------------------------------

You'll need to be able to write to the memory card listed above. You (or someone you know) probably already have this capability.
Many laptops and computers have these card readers built into them as these memory cards are commonly used in phones, cameras, etc.
If not, you can buy a Micro SD Card Reader that plugs into your computer via a USB port.
Eventually the Brewery Pi project may have an option to buy a Memory Card pre-loaded with the Brewery Pi system. Until then, you'll need to do it on your own.

`SD and Micro SD Card Reader on Amazon $7.49 <https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMKS2DI/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1>`_

Ethernet Cable *(Optional)*
---------------------------

The Raspberry Pi can connect to your network using it's Ethernet port or Wi-Fi.
Generally speaking, fixed wire Ethernet is faster than Wi-Fi, so that's what's recommended.
You (or someone that handles your IT duties) probably has an extra Ethernet cable lying around.
If not, you can buy one below based on how long you need it to be.

`Ethernet Cable on Amazon $4.49 - $11.49 <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00N2VISLW/ref=twister_B00O1RTQJE?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1>`_
